# Javascript Password Generator

## Description

As a future software engineer, I want to be able to create projects that utilize JavaScript code to create a random password generator.  This random password generator should be able to recieve inputs regarding certain parameters that the USER would like to have set for their password.  These parameters include having a certain length for their password as well as upper/lower case, specialized symbols, and numbers.  This project helped me practice my if statements and for loops, while also teaching me try and catch statements in order to catch any errors that may occur.  Ultimately, I had fun creating this project and I hope to use this as a basis for future coding. 

## Technologies

I used HTML and CSS code that was already within the project files.  There was also some Javascript that was already there to be used in conjunction with new JavaScript that I wrote to provide additional functionality and to set the parameters. 

# Instalation

N/A

## Usage
This project takes in a button request to generate a new password.  Afterwards, the USER will be given a modal prompt to specify the length of the password they wish to set.  This can be set from a minimum of 8 characters to 138 characters.  Afterwards, the USER will be prompted to allow for lower case characters, then upper case characters, then numbers, and finally specialized characters/symbols.  With each prompt, the USER can opt out and hit cancel in order to deny the use of said parameter.  After the whole list of parameters has looped through, it will then generate a random password fitting the parameters set. 

## Licecnse

This project utilized VScode as the code editor.
